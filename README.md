## Errata

I discovered a few typos in the book which made out to the final version, even if the book has been proofread.

### Chapter 1

At page 14, the last sentence is "In Chapters 11 and 12" instead of "In Chapters 10 and 11".

### Chapter 2

At page 20, it's "of comments, whitespace, while functions, and variable names are mangled." instead "of comments, whitespace, and `while` functions, and variable names are mangled".

At page 22, it's "We will explore the first approach in Chapter 6" instead of "We will explore the first approach in Chapter 5".

At page 27 it's "In Chapter 8, we focus on Next.js" instead of "In Chapter 7, we focus on Next.js".

At page 27 it's "The whole Chapter 9 is devoted to testing" instead of "The whole Chapter 8 is devoted to testing".
